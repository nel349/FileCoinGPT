To send a message containing the myData JSON data to a specific target origin using window.postMessage(), you can pass the target origin as the second argument to the window.postMessage() method.

Here's an example of how you can send the myData JSON data to a specific target origin:

const storedData = localStorage.getItem('myData');
const jsonData = JSON.parse(storedData);
const targetOrigin = 'https://example.com';
window.postMessage({ type: 'myData', data: jsonData }, targetOrigin);
In this example, the window.postMessage() method is used to send a message containing the myData JSON data to the https://example.com target origin.

Note that the target origin must match the protocol, domain, and port of the target website or app, and must include the scheme (e.g. https://).

Also, keep in mind that the window.postMessage() method and the message event are subject to the same-origin policy, which means that you can only send messages to windows and frames with the same origin as your website or app, or to a specific target origin that you have permission to communicate with.
